This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The live code is available here: http://benjamin-michel-vvoosh-test.surge.sh/

Unfortunately, IMDB issues 403s when loading the images. So you will need to
run the code yourself in order to get the full experience.
